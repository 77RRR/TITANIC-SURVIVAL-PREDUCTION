 Titanic Survival Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on available passenger data. It is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that utilizes classification techniques to analyze and interpret patterns in the dataset.

 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Titanic Dataset**, which contains information about individual passengers, including:
- Passenger ID
- Age
- Gender
- Ticket Class
- Fare
- Cabin
- Number of Siblings/Spouses aboard
- Number of Parents/Children aboard
- Embarked Port
- Survival Status (Target Variable: 1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive)

The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle's Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory

 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading: Import the Titanic dataset.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical features into numerical values, and normalize data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data distributions and relationships between features.
4. Feature Engineering: Select relevant features for training the model.
5. Model Selection & Training: Train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
7. Predictions & Deployment (Optional): Use the trained model to predict survival outcomes for new passenger data.

 How to Run the Project
 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

 Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Load the dataset and run the notebook cells sequentially.
4. Train and evaluate the model.
5. Modify parameters and compare model performance.

 Results & Findings
- The survival rate was higher for female passengers.
- First-class passengers had a higher survival probability.
- Age and fare also influenced survival chances.
- Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best among tested models.

 Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
